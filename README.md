To Do List Javascript

We are going to create a basic to do list app in javascript with the following features:

Our app is going to work in the following steps:

1-Load tasks: When the page is loaded, the app will check if there is any task in localStorage. If there is any task, it will display them.
2-Add task: When the user clicks on the add button, the app will add the task to the list and store it in localStorage.
3-Edit task: When user click on the task itself then they can edit the task and when they remove focus from the task, the app will update the task in localStorage.
4-Mark complete: When the user clicks on the checkbox, the app will mark the task as completed and store it in localStorage.
5-Remove task: When the user clicks on the trash button, the app will remove the task from the list and also remove it from localStorage.
